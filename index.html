    <h1 id="Home">Who are Mel and Brook and why are they so perfect?</h1>
    <p> This is my very first web page so bare with me.</p>
    <p> Mel and Brook first met on the 26th of june 2025 in London Bridge station. At frist Brook was annoyed as Mel was the tiniest bit late but once he saw her, he realised that he would hours just to see her face. they spent as much time together as they could before they both parted ways. Although they were seperatedshe was the only thing that Brook could think about and was determined to be with her again. </p>
<h2 id="MEL"> MMMEEELLL </h2>    
<p> Lets talk about the most beautiful, the cutestes and the kindest person ever. Mel was born on the 10th of May 2004 in  little town called Juiz de Fora ( NOT fodda) in Brazil, she spent the first 8 years of her life there before moving to Dubai. There she became the princess of Dubai where she rules with an iron fist! After acing her studies (with ease) she went to study in the Netherlands, but she soon realised that she was way too cool for the country a looked to study in Spain. Obviously she got accepted, and began studying Psychology Universidad Europea Madrid. She is cureently in her second year and at the top of her class (famously). Now a quick detour so we can see how pretty she is</p>

<h3 id="Brook"> Now a Little bit about Brook </h3>
<p> Brook was born on the 5th of July 2003 in London, after trying to find the best paper airoplane design he found a keen intrest of origami and became pretty sick at it, he then saw a David Blane clip on youtube and tried his hand at magic for a few years until he realised that he wasnt that good and it wasnt that cool. He went to Swansea University to study Geography, after a year he learnt that this wasnt the path he wanted to take but he wanted to finsh what he started, and it helped that he was surrounded by his good friends. After Uni, he worked in a thai cocktail bar, it was a good gig but he did not enjoy the hospitality feild.</p>
